🧾 Add Resume Download Button

- Add a visible "Download Resume" button in the header or contact section.
- When clicked, it should download `resume.pdf` (you can link it to a placeholder file for now).

---

✉️ Activate Contact Form

- Make the existing form functional using [Formspree.io].
- Add a real or placeholder Formspree action link so it works.
- Example: `<form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-id" method="POST">`

---

🖼️ Insert Project Screenshots

- In the project/cards section, include example placeholder screenshots (use `/images/project1.jpg`, etc.).
- Use Tailwind utility classes to make sure images are responsive and cleanly styled.
- If no images exist yet, use dummy `src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200"`.

---

📷 Optimize Profile Image

- Make sure `profile.jpg` inside `/images/` is styled with Tailwind (e.g. `rounded-full`, `w-32`, `h-32`).
- Add `alt` text for accessibility.

---

📌 General Notes

- Don’t change the layout too much — just enhance what's already there.
- Use semantic HTML and Tailwind for styling.
- Keep JavaScript minimal and clean (no frameworks).
- Don't add extra sections like blog, testimonials, or filtering yet.

Please complete the changes above and update the portfolio accordingly.
